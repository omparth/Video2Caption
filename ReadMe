3)Details of the caption generation method-

This project uses a simple and efficient pipeline to generate captions from uploaded videos. The flow is designed around AssemblyAI, which provides fast and accurate speech-to-text results.

-Video Upload
	
Users upload an .mp4 video through the interface.
The video is previewed instantly, so users can confirm the file before generating captions.

-Caption Editor

Once transcription completes, the captions load into video that user can see the view in preview Section and

Preview the timing along with the video

This step ensures captions are accurate and perfectly timed before rendering.



-Rendering With Captions

When the user clicks “Export,” the project uses:

Remotion - to render captioned frames

FFmpeg - to encode the final MP4 and burn the captions into the video

This produces a final file with hard subtitles.



-Download

The rendered MP4 is streamed back to the client through an API route, and the browser automatically downloads it.
